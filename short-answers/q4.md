# Question

What is an Abstract Data Type (ADT)?

# Answer
An abstract data type is the abstract idea of what a type of data does and doesn’t delve into how it really functions under-the-hood.
For example, an integer data type is usually a number, and has the ability to be added, subtracted, multiplied, divided, etc. We don’t know how these data structures specifically work, we just know what we can do with them
