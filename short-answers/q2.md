# Question

What are the advantages and disadvantages of using singly linked lists versus doubly linked lists, thinking of memory usage, traversal capabilities, insertion time, and use cases? Please mention at least two.

# Answer
## Singly linked 
### Advantages: 
    
* Efficient memory usage for dynamic memory allocation, meaning memory is eaten up only when a node is created (and only requires additional memory for the pointer to the next node). Much less memory is taken up compared to doubly linked node lists.

* Fastest time complexity for traversing singly linked lists is O(1) due to how straightforward traversing the list is (node.next always points to the next node, allowing you to go down the list fast and easy)


### Disadvantages: 

* Inserting a node that isn't positioned to be at the head or tail takes O(n) time complexity, and can take a long time in cases where you have to traverse through large lists 

* Are the most useful when forward traversal is required or when insertion/deletion operations at the head/tail are occuring, limited efficiency  

## Doubly linked 
### Advantages:

* Offer flexibility in traversal and dynamic implementation of algorithms 

* Support bidirectional traversal, which allows you to traverse the list forwards AND backwards (woo!) by having pointers to both the next and previous nodes


### Disadvantages:

* Since they have more pointers, they take up more memory 

* Cannot insert a node at a random position in the list, meaning they still have O(n) time complexity
