# Question

What are the advantages and disadvantages of using linked lists versus arrays in terms of insertion/removal time, random access time, memory usage, and traversal capabilities? Mention at least 3.

# Answer
Advantages/disadvantages of linked lists:
## 1. insertion/removal 
    Advantage: constant time complexity is the worst case scenario for insertion and removal, very simple process of adjusting pointers (not to worry about shifting nodes)

    Disadvantage: can't go faster than O(n) because you MUST traverse through the linked list

## 2. random access time - 
    Advantage: O(n) time complexity due to traversing from beginning to end through the linked list in order to find the node

    Disadvantage: Slower than arrays because linked lists do not support direct indexing (targetting an index or position in the linked list directly) like arrays do, making their time complexity slower than arrays (O(1)).

## 3. memory usage - 
    Advantage: Efficient memory usage for dynamic memory allocation, meaning memory is eaten up only when a node is created (and only requires additional memory for the pointer to the next node).

    Disadvantage: Take up more memory than arrays do due to needing extra memory to store the pointers 

## 4. traversal capabilities - 
    Advantage: traversing from one node to the next has a time complexity of O(1), suitable for when traversing is a common operation 

    Disadvantage: Has the potential for cache misses and being slower when it comes to traversing an entire linked list, which can take a long time with large lists
