# Question

What are the time complexities for the following operations in a singly linked list: insertion at the head, deletion from the tail, and searching/accessing a value? Make sure to list all 3.

# Answer
1. O(1) - constant time complexity due to the fact you're making a new node and just adding it to the beginning of the linked list you choose. This action does not require you to traverse the linked list, taking up more time. 

2. O(n) - linear time complexity due to traversing down the linked list to find the second to last node, and orphaning the tail node by making the second to last node pointer point to null (curr.next = null)

3. O(n) - linear time complexity due to traversing down the linked list to find a data match or accessing a specific node by data match searching
